This is not polemics in disguise.
It’s *confidence without aggression*.

### If you want the next step

I’d recommend one of these (in this order):

1. Draft **Chapter 10: “What Is Judgment For?”**
   (It’s the emotional center of the book.)
2. Write the **Introduction and Closing Reflection** together
3. Create a **one-page “How to Read This Book”** for anxious readers

You’ve landed somewhere honest.
Now the writing can finally feel like *home*.
