# Chapter 3

## 1 - The Image of God

### *What does God mean to awaken in us by calling us his “image”?*

The opening words of Genesis are spoken slowly, almost reverently, as though God wishes us to hear them before anything else is said about us:

> *“God said, ‘Let’s make man in our image, after our likeness.’”* (Genesis 1:26, WEB)

Before there is effort or failure, before obedience or estrangement, before fear ever enters the story, there is blessing. A naming. A declaration of worth. Whatever the image of God means, it is spoken over humanity before we have earned it—and before we have lost anything.

The text itself does not rush to define this image as something indestructible hidden within us. Instead, it places the language of image alongside a calling:

> *“Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”* (Genesis 1:26, WEB)

The image appears not as a possession to be defended, but as a vocation to be lived. Humanity is entrusted with care, with responsibility, with participation in God’s good ordering of the world. Dominion here is not domination, but stewardship—authority shaped by love.

This suggests that the image of God may be less about what we *contain* and more about what we are meant to *reflect*.

A mirror does not generate light of its own. It receives light and gives it back. If the mirror cracks, the light is not destroyed—but it may scatter or dim. Still, the source remains, patient and unchanged.

Scripture itself uses the language of image in ways that feel relational rather than mechanical. A few chapters later, Genesis tells us:

> *“Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.”* (Genesis 5:3, WEB)

A child bears the image of a parent—not as an identical copy, but as a living resemblance. There is familiarity without sameness. Dependence without shame. Growth without rivalry. The likeness is real, but it unfolds over time.

So it may be with God and humanity. To be made in God’s image is not to share God’s self-existence, but to share God’s orientation toward life, love, creativity, and relationship. We resemble God not by possessing divine attributes in full, but by being shaped toward God—capable of knowing, choosing, responding, and becoming.

This is why Scripture often speaks of the image as something renewed rather than merely preserved. Paul writes of a new self that:

> *“is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its Creator.”* (Colossians 3:10, WEB)

Renewal implies patience. Process. Care. It suggests that God is not surprised by fracture, nor deterred by distortion. The image may be obscured, but it is not abandoned.

And when Scripture lifts our eyes further still, it speaks not only of renewal, but of fulfillment. Paul dares to say:

> *“As we have borne the image of those made of dust, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.”* (1 Corinthians 15:49, WEB)

The horizon is not merely a return to beginnings, but a transformation into something fuller than what we have yet known. The image is not static. It is directional.

This movement finds its clearest expression in Christ, who is called:

> *“the image of the invisible God.”* (Colossians 1:15, WEB)

In Jesus, the image is no longer abstract. It has hands that heal. Eyes that weep. Feet that walk toward the excluded. The image of God looks like mercy embodied. Like faithfulness under pressure. Like love that does not withdraw when misunderstood or wounded.

Seen this way, the image of God is not a fragile doctrine we must protect, nor a metaphysical guarantee we must secure. It is a divine intention spoken over humanity and patiently brought to completion. It tells us who we are meant to become, not what we must fear losing.

The image does not say, *“You cannot die.”*
It says, *“You were made for God.”*

It does not insist, *“You possess life in yourself.”*
It whispers, *“You were fashioned to receive life—and to grow into its fullness.”*

And if the image is something God renews, restores, and perfects, then even our incompleteness does not threaten it. The One who first spoke dignity over dust has not forgotten the sound of his own voice.
