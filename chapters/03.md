# 3. What Does Scripture Mesn By Immortality?

## I. Why “Immortality” Must Be Defined Carefully

Few words carry more weight in discussions of death and the life beyond it than *immortality*. And yet, few words are used with less precision. It is often assumed rather than examined, inherited rather than defined. Entire theological systems are built upon it before its meaning is ever clarified.

This lack of care creates confusion. Different traditions speak confidently about the soul’s destiny while quietly assuming very different things about what immortality actually is. Some imagine it as endless conscious existence by default. Others treat it as a reward granted only to the faithful. Still others deny it altogether. Yet these disagreements often take place without first asking what Scripture itself means when it speaks of immortality.

Part of the difficulty lies in how easily philosophical assumptions slip into theological language. Immortality is frequently treated as a property—something a soul either possesses or does not possess. Once granted, it is assumed to function automatically, independent of relationship, purpose, or divine intention. In this framework, the central question becomes where the immortal soul will spend eternity, rather than how its existence is sustained at all.

Scripture approaches the matter differently. It speaks sparingly about immortality, and when it does, it does so with care. Immortality is not presented as a natural human attribute, nor as a neutral fact about consciousness. It appears instead as something awaited, something received, something put on. Its meaning is bound up with resurrection, relationship, and participation in the life of God.

Because of this, immortality cannot be treated as a simple synonym for endless existence. To do so risks flattening the biblical vision and importing conclusions Scripture does not clearly make. If immortality is assumed too quickly, questions about death, judgment, and restoration are already decided before they are honestly asked.

This chapter begins, then, not by defending a particular outcome, but by slowing down. Before asking what happens after death, we must ask what kind of life Scripture is speaking about when it uses the language of immortality. Is it describing an inherent capacity of the soul? A divine gift sustained by relationship? A future condition tied to resurrection and communion with God?

These questions matter because immortality is not an abstract concept. It touches the deepest human fears—of abandonment, meaninglessness, and loss. If immortality is misunderstood, it can either become a source of false reassurance or a tool of terror. If it is understood rightly, it may reveal something far more demanding and far more hopeful: that life endures not because it must, but because it is held.

To define immortality carefully is not an academic exercise. It is an act of faithfulness to the text and to the human questions that bring us to it. Only then can we ask, with integrity, what death takes away, what it reveals, and what it may yet give.

## II. God Alone as Inherently Immortal

When Scripture speaks of immortality, it does so with a striking restraint. It does not begin by attributing immortality to the human soul. Instead, it locates immortality first—and decisively—in God alone.

This is stated most plainly when God is described as the one *“who alone has immortality”* (1 Timothy 6:16). The claim is simple, but its implications are far-reaching. Immortality, in its fullest sense, is not a shared property of all conscious beings. It belongs uniquely to God. God does not receive life from another, nor depend on anything beyond himself to exist. God’s being is not derived, sustained, or threatened. God is life.

This aligns with the broader scriptural witness. God is repeatedly named as the source from whom all life flows. In the Gospel of John, Jesus speaks of the Father as the one who *“has life in himself”* (John 5:26), a phrase that marks a clear distinction between divine life and created life. What God has by nature, creatures receive by gift.

The Psalms echo this distinction in more poetic terms. Human beings are described as living by breath that is given and withdrawn. *“When you take away their breath, they die and return to their dust. When you send forth your Spirit, they are created”* (Psalm 104:29–30). Life is portrayed not as a possession that runs on its own, but as a reality continually sustained by God’s presence and will.

This framing matters because it prevents a subtle but common mistake: imagining immortality as a neutral extension of creaturely existence. Scripture does not depict created beings as small versions of God, each carrying a spark of self-sustaining life. It depicts them as participants—living because they are upheld.

Even when Scripture speaks of eternal life, it does so relationally rather than mechanically. Eternal life is not first defined as endless duration, but as *knowing* God (John 17:3). The emphasis falls not on the length of existence, but on the depth of communion. Life endures because it is shared with the One who endures.

This helps clarify why immortality is never treated as automatic. Human beings are not said to possess immortality by default. Instead, they are invited into a life that transcends death through relationship with God. Immortality, then, is not the baseline condition of the soul; it is the fulfillment of creaturely life through participation in divine life.

By locating immortality in God alone, Scripture preserves both humility and hope. Humility, because human life is revealed as contingent and dependent. Hope, because that dependence rests not on fragility or chance, but on the faithfulness of the One who gives life.

If God alone is inherently immortal, then whatever continuity creatures experience must be understood as sustained rather than assumed. Life persists not because it cannot end, but because God does not cease to give it. Immortality, in this light, is not self-existence carried forward indefinitely. It is existence continually upheld in relationship with the living God.

This distinction prepares us for the questions that follow. If immortality belongs properly to God, then human immortality—if it exists at all—must be understood as gift, promise, and participation. It cannot be separated from the character of the God who gives it, nor from the relationship in which it is received.
