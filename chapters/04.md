## 1 – Beginning with Scripture, Not Assumption

### *What does it mean to listen before we decide?*

We begin where faith has always begun—not with certainty, but with listening.

Scripture invites us to slow our speech, to quiet our conclusions, and to attend carefully to what is actually said. When questions arise about life and death, hope and destiny, the Bible does not rush to satisfy curiosity. Instead, it speaks with a kind of holy restraint, as though guarding something precious from being handled too quickly.

This restraint is not absence. It is reverence.

From the opening pages, we are reminded that life itself is a gift received, not a possession claimed. Humanity is formed from the dust of the ground and animated by the breath of God (Genesis 2:7). Life flows toward us. It does not originate in us. Whatever hope we carry must therefore remain tethered to the One who gives and sustains life.

Scripture consistently directs our gaze this way—not inward toward what we might possess by nature, but outward and upward toward the faithfulness of God. “In him we live, and move, and have our being” (Acts 17:28). Even our continued existence is framed as dependence, not autonomy.

This posture matters. When we begin with assumptions—especially comforting ones—we risk speaking too soon. But when we begin with Scripture’s own cadence, we learn to wait. We learn to trust that what God intends to reveal will be revealed in due time, and that what is not yet fully named may still be safely held.

The Bible does not always answer our questions in the way we expect. Yet it consistently draws us into relationship rather than resolution. It forms patience before it forms conclusions. It teaches us to hope without demanding immediacy.

There is wisdom in this. For faith that begins with listening is faith that can grow.

So we begin here—not to reduce hope, but to ground it. Not to settle every question, but to rest them in God’s keeping. Scripture will speak. But first, it invites us to listen.
