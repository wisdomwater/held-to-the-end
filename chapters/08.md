## Held to the End

### I. What Our Ending Says About God

Every vision of the end tells us something about the God we trust along the way. Eschatology is never merely about the future; it is a confession about character. What we believe God will ultimately do reveals what we believe God is like.

If the story of creation ends in partial healing, then love has limits. If it ends in permanent abandonment, then fear was justified all along. And if some wounds remain forever unhealed, then victory is incomplete—not because suffering was real, but because love did not go far enough.

Scripture does not present the end as a compromise between mercy and justice. It presents it as their fulfillment. The God who creates out of love does not grow weary of that love when it is tested. The God who enters history in Christ does not abandon the work when it becomes costly. What is revealed at the end must be coherent with what has been revealed in the middle.

This is why the question of “how it all ends” matters so deeply. We do not ask it out of idle curiosity, but because we are trying to discern whether God can be trusted with everything. Not just with obedience and belief, but with failure, fear, and truth told without disguise.

A God who heals only what is easy to heal, or saves only what quickly consents, would not be fully victorious. Such a God would be powerful, perhaps, but not complete. The Christian hope dares to imagine something more enduring: a God whose love is not outpaced by resistance, whose mercy is not exhausted by complexity, and whose justice does not leave creation fractured.

To hope for the restoration of all things is not to minimize sin or suffering. It is to refuse to believe that evil has a longer reach than love. It is to trust that the God revealed in Christ—who forgives enemies, bears wounds, and rises without revenge—will remain faithful to that same character to the very end.

What our ending says about God matters, because it shapes how we relate to God now. Whether we draw near in trust or keep our distance in fear often depends on what we believe awaits us. The end we imagine quietly teaches us who God is—and whether God is safe to love.

### II. Justice and Mercy Are Not Rivals

One of the deepest fractures in how we imagine God is the belief that justice and mercy compete within him—as though more of one must mean less of the other. This inner conflict is often projected onto God because it is familiar to us. We know justice that wounds and mercy that overlooks. We know punishment that satisfies anger and forgiveness that leaves harm unhealed. But Scripture does not describe God as divided in this way.

In Scripture, justice and mercy do not cancel each other out; they complete each other. Justice is God’s commitment to truth—to seeing things as they really are and refusing to let harm be dismissed or denied. Mercy is God’s commitment to healing—to restoring what truth reveals as broken. Justice without mercy would leave the world exposed but unhealed. Mercy without justice would leave the world comforted but unchanged. God refuses both outcomes.

This unity is named again and again in the biblical witness. The psalms speak of righteousness and peace kissing each other, not contending for dominance. The prophets describe judgment as something meant to turn hearts back toward life, not drive them away. And in Christ, justice and mercy are no longer abstract qualities at all—they are embodied in a life that tells the truth without abandoning the sinner.

At the cross, this unity becomes unmistakable. Sin is not minimized. Harm is not ignored. Truth is spoken in blood and breath. And yet mercy does not wait until justice is satisfied somewhere else. Mercy is present in the very act of judgment. Forgiveness flows not after suffering is complete, but from within it. Justice names the wound. Mercy bears it. Love holds both without contradiction.

This matters because a God whose justice ultimately contradicts his mercy would be unstable—a God whose final act undoes his own heart. Such a God could be feared, but never fully trusted. Scripture offers a different vision: a God whose justice is an expression of love’s seriousness, and whose mercy is an expression of love’s endurance.

When justice and mercy are reunited, judgment is no longer imagined as a threat to goodness, but as its servant. Judgment clears the way for mercy to be real. Mercy ensures that judgment does not become destruction. Together, they reveal a God who refuses both denial and despair.

To believe that justice and mercy fulfill one another is to believe that God is whole. Not conflicted. Not internally divided. Not forced to choose between attributes. God’s justice heals because it is merciful. God’s mercy restores because it is just.

And this wholeness is not only theological—it is relational. A God who holds justice and mercy together can be trusted with the truth of who we are. Nothing needs to be hidden. Nothing needs to be defended. Truth will be told, and mercy will remain.

This is the God toward whom the story bends—not a judge balanced precariously between wrath and compassion, but a healer whose faithfulness refuses to leave either truth or love behind.

### III. The God We Can Trust With Everything

There is a difference between believing that God is powerful and believing that God is trustworthy. Power may inspire awe. Truth may command assent. Goodness may be affirmed in principle. But trust asks something more intimate: *Can I place my whole self here without fear?*

Many people believe in God while keeping a careful distance from him. Not because they doubt his existence, but because they are unsure of his safety. They wonder whether full honesty would lead to rejection, whether closeness would expose them to harm, or whether love might ultimately be conditional. These questions are not failures of faith. They are the places where faith seeks a home.

Scripture does not ask us to trust an abstract idea of God. It points us toward a face—a God who makes himself known in Christ. In Jesus, power does not crush; it serves. Truth does not humiliate; it heals. Authority does not dominate; it lays itself down. This is the measure by which trust becomes possible.

A God who can be trusted is not one who ignores what is wrong, but one who tells the truth without abandoning the one being told. Trust grows where truth and mercy meet. It grows where judgment does not sever relationship, but deepens it by removing pretense. A God who cannot bear the truth about us cannot be trusted with our lives.

The cross stands as the clearest answer to the question of trust. It reveals a God who sees the worst humanity can do and responds not by retreating, but by drawing nearer. This is not indifference to evil. It is courage greater than fear. It is love that remains present even when truth is costly.

To ask whether God can be trusted is to ask whether God will remain when everything is known. Scripture answers not with theory, but with presence. *“I am with you always,”* Jesus says—not only in obedience or understanding, but to the very end. Trust does not rest on our consistency. It rests on God’s.

When we imagine an end in which some are healed and others abandoned, trust becomes fragile. Fear becomes reasonable. Distance becomes prudent. But when the end reveals a God who completes what he begins, trust finds a place to settle. The soul can risk honesty because it believes mercy will not withdraw.

A trustworthy God is one whose power is shaped by love, whose truth is held with care, and whose goodness endures beyond resistance. Such a God does not need to be managed or appeased. He invites closeness. He welcomes truth. He remains.

This is the kind of God whose story we have been tracing. Not a God who demands trust through threat, but one who earns trust through faithfulness. Not a God who wins by exclusion, but one who completes the work by staying.

If God can be trusted with everything—our failures, our fears, our truths—then hope is no longer a risk. It becomes a resting place.
