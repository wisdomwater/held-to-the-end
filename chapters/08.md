### I. What Our Ending Says About God

Every vision of the end tells us something about the God we trust along the way. Eschatology is never merely about the future; it is a confession about character. What we believe God will ultimately do reveals what we believe God is like.

If the story of creation ends in partial healing, then love has limits. If it ends in permanent abandonment, then fear was justified all along. And if some wounds remain forever unhealed, then victory is incomplete—not because suffering was real, but because love did not go far enough.

Scripture does not present the end as a compromise between mercy and justice. It presents it as their fulfillment. The God who creates out of love does not grow weary of that love when it is tested. The God who enters history in Christ does not abandon the work when it becomes costly. What is revealed at the end must be coherent with what has been revealed in the middle.

This is why the question of “how it all ends” matters so deeply. We do not ask it out of idle curiosity, but because we are trying to discern whether God can be trusted with everything. Not just with obedience and belief, but with failure, fear, and truth told without disguise.

A God who heals only what is easy to heal, or saves only what quickly consents, would not be fully victorious. Such a God would be powerful, perhaps, but not complete. The Christian hope dares to imagine something more enduring: a God whose love is not outpaced by resistance, whose mercy is not exhausted by complexity, and whose justice does not leave creation fractured.

To hope for the restoration of all things is not to minimize sin or suffering. It is to refuse to believe that evil has a longer reach than love. It is to trust that the God revealed in Christ—who forgives enemies, bears wounds, and rises without revenge—will remain faithful to that same character to the very end.

What our ending says about God matters, because it shapes how we relate to God now. Whether we draw near in trust or keep our distance in fear often depends on what we believe awaits us. The end we imagine quietly teaches us who God is—and whether God is safe to love.
