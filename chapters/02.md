# What Does It Mean To Be Mortal?

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
### **Mortality Is More Than Biological Death**

To be mortal is not simply to be a creature whose body will one day stop breathing. Stones wear down, flowers wither, animals perish—but human mortality carries a different weight. We are aware of our ending. We do not merely die; we *know* that we will. This awareness shapes the way we love, the way we fear, and the way we search for meaning. Mortality becomes part of our consciousness, not just our biology. It whispers to us in moments of quiet, reminding us that our days are numbered, even as we are still learning how to live them.

This knowledge can feel like a burden, yet it is also what gives our lives depth. Because we know time is limited, moments matter. Love matters. Choices matter. The psalmist speaks with this awareness when he prays, “Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom” (Psalm 90:12). Mortality presses us toward wisdom—not the cold wisdom of resignation, but the tender wisdom that arises when life is held as precious rather than assumed to be endless.

And yet, this awareness often brings discomfort. We would rather not think about death, not because life is unpleasant, but because it is unfinished. We sense that we are still becoming—that something in us is meant to grow further, deepen, and unfold more fully. Mortality interrupts that becoming. It confronts us with limits before we feel complete. This is why death feels unnatural, even though it is universal. We were made from dust, yes—but we were also breathed into by God, animated by divine breath that longs for more than mere cessation (Genesis 2:7).

Seen this way, mortality is not simply a sentence passed upon humanity. It is a question placed gently before us. What does it mean to live well within limits? What does it mean to trust that our becoming is not cut short, even if our earthly days are? Mortality awakens longing—not only for more time, but for a love strong enough to carry our lives beyond their visible edges. It prepares the heart to ask whether death has the final word, or whether, somehow, we are held even there.

### **Human Awareness and the Loneliness of Mortality**

There is a particular kind of loneliness that belongs to being human. It is not the loneliness of being unloved or unseen, but the quieter solitude of consciousness itself. Each of us inhabits an interior world that no one else can fully enter. We can share words, gestures, memories, and affection—but the experience of being *this* self, in *this* body, moving through time toward an unknown end, remains uniquely ours. Mortality sharpens this solitude, because death is something each person must face alone, even when surrounded by those who love them.

This awareness can feel unsettling. Even in our closest relationships, there is a recognition that no one can die for us, and no one can step into that final moment on our behalf. Ecclesiastes names this quiet interiority when it says that God “has set eternity in the human heart, yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end” (Ecclesiastes 3:11). We sense that our lives are part of something larger, but we experience that mystery from within the limits of our own consciousness. The result is a longing for connection that no human relationship can completely satisfy.

And yet, this solitude is not a flaw. It is the space where love becomes personal rather than abstract. Because each life is interior and unrepeatable, each life matters. The loneliness of mortality reveals the depth of our need—not merely to be accompanied, but to be *known*. To be held not just socially, but existentially. To trust that the One who formed us knows us from the inside out, even in the places no other person can reach.

The Christian story quietly speaks into this solitude. “I am with you always,” Jesus says, “even to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:20). This is not a promise that mortality disappears, nor that fear never arises. It is a promise that the deepest loneliness is not ultimate. That even in the interior silence where no human voice can follow, we are not abandoned. The awareness that isolates us from one another may also be the doorway through which we discover that we have never truly been alone.

### **Death as an Unknown Threshold**

One of the most unsettling aspects of mortality is not simply that death will come, but that it remains unknowable until it does. We can observe death from the outside. We can study it, describe its biological processes, and witness it in others. But no one can report back from within it. Death stands before us as a threshold we know we must cross, yet cannot preview. This silence gives death its weight. It resists explanation. It humbles language. And so, it often fills the imagination with fear.

Human beings are meaning-makers. We are comforted by understanding, by stories that explain what comes next. Death interrupts that desire. It refuses to be domesticated by certainty. Even faith, when honest, does not remove the mystery. Scripture itself speaks with restraint here, saying only that “now we see in a mirror dimly” and that full knowing belongs to another time (1 Corinthians 13:12). Mortality places us in that dimness. It asks us to live faithfully without full sight.

This uncertainty can feel threatening, but it also exposes something tender within us. We want assurance not because we crave control, but because we long for safety. We want to know that crossing this threshold does not mean falling into nothingness, or being lost to meaning altogether. The fear of the unknown is, at its core, a fear of being unheld—of stepping beyond the edge of life without a hand to receive us.

Yet throughout the biblical story, God is revealed not as one who explains every passage in advance, but as one who *goes before*. “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,” the psalmist writes, “I will fear no evil, for you are with me” (Psalm 23:4). The reassurance is not a map, but a presence. Death remains a threshold—but not an empty one. It becomes a place where trust, rather than knowledge, carries the soul forward.

### **Our Attempts to Outrun Mortality**

Because death unsettles us, we often learn ways to look away from it. We fill our days with motion, responsibility, planning, and productivity. We organize our lives around goals and timelines, convincing ourselves—sometimes unconsciously—that staying busy will keep mortality at a distance. If we remain useful, effective, and in control, perhaps we can postpone the deeper questions. This is not because we are shallow, but because we are vulnerable. Distraction becomes a form of self-protection.

Yet mortality is patient. It does not need to announce itself loudly to be present. Even when unspoken, it shapes our urgency, our anxiety, and our restlessness. We hurry because time feels scarce. We grasp because loss feels inevitable. Jesus names this impulse gently when he asks, “Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?” (Matthew 6:27). The question is not accusatory—it is compassionate. It reveals how much effort we expend trying to secure what cannot be controlled.

Over time, this striving can leave us weary. When life becomes primarily about managing outcomes, the soul quietly starves. We may achieve much and still feel unfinished. Productivity can build a life, but it cannot answer the deeper ache beneath it. Mortality reminds us that no amount of preparation can fully insulate us from loss. Eventually, control gives way to surrender—not as failure, but as truth.

This is where mortality becomes a teacher rather than an enemy. It invites us to loosen our grip and return to trust. Scripture speaks of a God who “gives to all life, breath, and everything else” (Acts 17:25). To receive life as gift rather than possession is not passive resignation—it is freedom. When we stop running from our limits, we begin to live within them with grace. Mortality no longer needs to be outrun. It can be faced, slowly and honestly, as part of a life that is being held.

### **The Fear Beneath the Fear**

When we speak about fearing death, it is rarely death alone that we mean. Pain, loss, and separation all play their part, but beneath them lies a quieter, more enduring fear: the fear that our lives may not have mattered. Mortality brings with it the question of significance. We wonder whether our love was enough, whether our efforts bore fruit, whether our existence left any lasting mark. The finality of death presses these questions forward, not as accusations, but as longings.

This fear reveals something tender about the human heart. We do not fear insignificance because we are proud, but because we were made for meaning. We were created to give and receive love, to participate in something larger than ourselves. Scripture echoes this longing when it speaks of a God who remembers, who sees, who knows each person by name. “Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?” Jesus asks, “Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care” (Matthew 10:29). If even the smallest lives are noticed, then our desire to matter is not misplaced.

Still, mortality confronts us with unfinished stories. There are words left unsaid, wounds left unhealed, and growth left incomplete. We sense that life is meant to move toward wholeness, yet death appears to interrupt that movement. This is why we grieve not only the loss of time, but the loss of becoming. We long for the assurance that what began in us is not abandoned mid-sentence.

Here, the Christian hope speaks quietly but persistently. It tells of a God who finishes what He begins, who does not forget the work of His hands. “He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion,” Paul writes, “until the day of Christ Jesus” (Philippians 1:6). The fear beneath the fear is met not with denial, but with promise: that our lives are not evaluated by their visible outcomes alone, and that nothing entrusted to divine love is ultimately wasted.

### **The Fear of Being Forgotten**

As mortality presses closer, another fear quietly emerges: the fear of being forgotten. We wonder whether our lives will fade without trace, whether the love we offered will dissolve into memory and then into silence. This fear is not only about legacy or recognition; it is about belonging. To be forgotten feels like being erased, as though our existence might slip beyond remembrance altogether. Death raises the question not just of *how* we end, but of whether we are carried forward in any meaningful way.

This fear touches something deeply relational within us. We were not made to exist in isolation, nor to disappear without witness. Scripture often speaks of God as one who remembers—not because God is forgetful, but because remembering is an act of love. When God “remembers” Noah in the flood, or Israel in exile, it signals not recollection but faithfulness. “Can a mother forget the baby at her breast?” God asks through the prophet Isaiah. “Though she may forget, I will not forget you” (Isaiah 49:15). In this light, the fear of being forgotten is answered not by monuments or memories, but by divine attention.

And yet, from within mortal life, this assurance can feel fragile. We watch how quickly names disappear from history, how lives once vibrant become footnotes or vanish entirely. Mortality teaches us how little control we have over remembrance. This can be deeply unsettling—especially if we imagine that meaning depends on being recalled by the world. But the Christian story gently shifts the question: What if remembrance does not depend on human memory alone?

To be held in the memory of God is not the same as being remembered by history. It is deeper, quieter, and more enduring. Scripture speaks of lives “hidden with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:3), suggesting a safekeeping beyond visibility. Mortality may carry our names out of public awareness, but it does not carry them out of divine care. The fear of being forgotten gives way, slowly, to the hope of being known—fully, faithfully, and forever.

### **The Ache of an Unfinished Life**

Alongside the fear of being forgotten is another quiet sorrow: the sense that life ends before it is complete. Most of us do not feel finished. There are parts of ourselves still forming, wounds still healing, wisdom still ripening. We live with the awareness that growth takes time—and mortality reminds us that time is limited. Death feels less like a conclusion and more like an interruption, arriving while the soul is still learning how to become fully itself.

This ache is not dissatisfaction with life, but reverence for it. We sense that existence is meant to unfold, to deepen, to move toward wholeness. Scripture reflects this intuition when it speaks of creation itself “groaning as in the pains of childbirth” (Romans 8:22). Growth is ongoing. Becoming is not rushed. The pain we feel at the thought of an unfinished life reveals that we were made for more than a brief unfolding. We long not merely to exist, but to mature into love.

Mortality presses against this longing sharply. It raises difficult questions: What happens to growth that feels incomplete? What becomes of lessons learned too late, or healing begun but not finished? These questions can haunt us if we imagine death as a hard stop rather than a passage. If life is only what we can see and measure, then incompleteness feels tragic. But if life is held within a larger faithfulness, then incompleteness may not mean abandonment.

The Christian hope quietly insists on this larger horizon. It speaks of a God who is patient with becoming, who does not measure souls by timelines. “Beloved, now we are children of God,” John writes, “and what we will be has not yet been made known” (1 John 3:2). Mortality may close one chapter, but it does not cancel the story. The ache of an unfinished life becomes, in this light, not evidence of failure, but a sign that growth continues beyond what we can presently see.

### **The Fear of Abandonment**

Beneath all the fears stirred by mortality—fear of pain, fear of insignificance, fear of being forgotten, fear of incompleteness—there lies one deeper concern: the fear of being abandoned. Death confronts us with the possibility that we may be left alone at the very moment we most need to be held. It is not simply the end of breath that troubles us, but the question of whether anyone remains with us when breath fails. The soul wonders whether the final crossing is solitary, or whether love accompanies us even there.

This fear reaches into our earliest experiences. To be human is to learn trust slowly, through presence and care. We know the distress of separation long before we can name it. Mortality awakens that ancient vulnerability. It asks whether the God we have trusted in life remains trustworthy when life itself slips away. Scripture does not dismiss this fear. Even Jesus voices it from the cross: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46). The cry is not disbelief—it is the depth of trust speaking honestly in the face of abandonment.

Yet the Christian story does not end with that cry. It insists that abandonment is not the final reality, even when it is deeply felt. The resurrection does not erase the experience of death, but it reframes it. It reveals a God who enters into human vulnerability rather than standing apart from it. “I will never leave you nor forsake you,” God promises (Hebrews 13:5)—not as an abstraction, but as a pledge sealed through presence, suffering, and fidelity.

Mortality brings us to the edge of trust. It strips away illusions of self-sufficiency and asks a single, honest question: Is love strong enough to carry us through the end? The Christian hope answers not with certainty of explanation, but with confidence of companionship. We are not promised an easy crossing—but we are promised that we do not cross alone. Even in death, we are held.

### **What Our Fears Reveal About What We Love**

The fears stirred by mortality are not random or shallow. They point, quietly and persistently, toward what matters most to us. We fear death because we love life. We fear loss because we have known connection. We fear incompleteness because we were made for growth. Mortality does not invent these longings—it exposes them. In this way, fear becomes less an enemy to conquer and more a messenger revealing the shape of our deepest values.

When we look honestly at our fears, we begin to see how profoundly relational we are. We are not merely afraid of ending; we are afraid of losing love, meaning, and belonging. Scripture affirms this relational core when it says that “God is love,” and that to be made in God’s image is to be oriented toward communion (1 John 4:8). Our fear of death, then, is not a failure of faith—it is evidence that we were created for enduring relationship, not disposable existence.

Mortality presses us to ask whether love itself is fragile or faithful. If love ends at death, then fear makes sense. But if love is rooted in something deeper than time, then fear may be pointing us toward hope we have not yet fully trusted. Jesus speaks into this tension when he says, “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me” (John 14:1). The invitation is not to suppress fear, but to allow it to lead us toward trust.

Seen in this light, fear becomes a doorway rather than a dead end. It teaches us what we cherish and what we refuse to believe is meaningless. The things we most fear losing are the things we most hope will endure. Mortality does not negate that hope—it sharpens it. It asks whether the love we have known is strong enough to carry us beyond the limits of our knowing, into a future still held by grace.

### **What Does It Mean To Be Mortal?**

Mortality is often experienced as a verdict—a limit imposed, a sentence passed, an ending declared. But when held in the light of faith, it begins to look more like an invitation. Not an invitation to deny fear or bypass grief, but an invitation to trust more deeply than certainty allows. Mortality calls us out of the illusion that we can secure ourselves and into the quieter hope that we are already being held.

Throughout this chapter, mortality has revealed not only what we fear, but what we long for: meaning that endures, love that does not abandon, growth that is not cut short. These longings are not accidental. They are echoes of the God who breathed life into us and continues to sustain it. Scripture speaks of this sustaining presence simply and profoundly: “In him we live and move and have our being” (Acts 17:28). Mortality does not remove us from that presence; it exposes how deeply we depend upon it.

Seen this way, death is not the opposite of life, but the place where life must finally be entrusted. The question mortality asks is not whether we will end, but whether we will be held. The Christian hope does not claim that death is easy or desirable. It claims something quieter and stronger: that love remains faithful even when control falls away. That what began in love is not abandoned in silence. That the God who accompanies us in life does not step back at its edge.

To live as mortals, then, is to practice trust. It is to learn—slowly, imperfectly—that our limits are not signs of rejection but reminders of relationship. We are finite, yes. But we are not forgotten. We are unfinished, but not abandoned. Mortality does not close the story; it opens us to the hope that we are, even to the end, held.
