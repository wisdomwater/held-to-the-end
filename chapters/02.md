## 2 - Beginning Where Scripture Begins

### *How do we learn what a human being truly is?*

When questions arise about death, the soul, or what lies beyond this life, there is a natural impulse to rush ahead—toward conclusions, explanations, and answers that promise certainty. But Scripture itself invites us to begin somewhere quieter.

It invites us to begin at the beginning.

Before we ask what happens when life ends, we are gently led to ask what life *is*. Before we wonder what survives death, we are asked to consider what it means to be alive at all. The Bible does not introduce humanity first through speculation, but through story. It opens not with theories of immortality, but with soil, breath, and the steady care of God.

This is not an evasion of our deepest questions. It is a grounding of them.

Genesis does not present human nature as an abstract puzzle to be solved, but as a gift to be received. We are invited to look at ourselves not as problems requiring explanation, but as creatures shaped by intention, relationship, and love. In this sense, Scripture resists both fear and overconfidence. It does not rush to explain everything, nor does it leave us without a place to stand.

> “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.”
> *(Genesis 1:1, WEB)*

Before there is argument, there is gift.
Before there is destiny, there is belonging.

To begin here is an act of humility. It is a confession that the meaning of human life is not discovered by looking inward alone, nor by borrowing assumptions from philosophy or tradition, but by listening attentively to the story Scripture tells about our origin. This does not diminish reason or reflection; it simply places them in their proper posture—downstream from creation, not upstream from it.

The Psalms echo this posture when they say:

> “Know that Yahweh, he is God.
> It is he who has made us, and we are his.
> We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.”
> *(Psalm 100:3, WEB)*

To know ourselves truly, then, is not first to analyze our components, but to remember our Source.

When we begin where Scripture begins, we are reminded that human life is not self-originating. We did not summon ourselves into being, nor do we sustain ourselves by our own power. Our existence is derivative, received, and continually upheld. Whatever may be said later about death, judgment, or restoration, this much is already clear: life itself is a gift held in trust.

And gifts are not explained before they are received.
They are first honored.

So we begin here—not to settle every question, but to let the first question be the right one:

*What does it mean to be a creature lovingly brought into being by God?*
