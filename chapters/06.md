## 6 - Concerning the Human Spirit

When people speak about the “spirit,” it is often because they are trying to protect something precious: the sense that a human life is more than dust, more than chemistry, more than a brief spark between two silences. And Scripture agrees that we are more than dust—yet it also teaches us to be careful and honest about what we claim, especially when grief is tender and fear is easily stirred. So we come to these passages quietly, asking not what we wish they said, but what they actually offer.

One of the most often repeated lines is Solomon’s: “the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.” It can sound, at first hearing, like a full description of a conscious self floating upward at death. But if we listen closely, Solomon says less than many assume. He does tell us that life is not self-made; it is received. He does tell us that the animating gift is not the body itself. He does tell us that what God gives, God can gather back. But he does not say—at least not here—that this “spirit” continues in awareness, speech, memory, and feeling after the body dies.

There is a simple parallel in Job that helps steady our imagination: Job speaks of God gathering back “spirit and breath,” and the result is that flesh perishes and man returns to dust. That language is strong and reverent—God gathers to Himself what is His—yet no one reads Job’s words and concludes that the “breath” is therefore a conscious person. It is the same kind of sacred plainness Solomon uses: the life-principle comes from God, and when God withdraws it, life ends.

If we take Solomon’s sentence as a tracing-back of creation—dust to dust, breath to the Giver—then the picture becomes clear without becoming speculative. God formed the body from the earth; God gave the breath of life; at death the breath is withdrawn, the person lies down in silence, and the body returns to the ground. In that sense the spirit “returns” to God in the same way it “came” from God: as life received, life sustained, and life now released back into the keeping of the One who holds all breath.

This reading also guards us from a painful tangle that often goes unnoticed: Solomon’s words apply to all people, not only to the righteous. If “the spirit returns to God” means every person immediately goes consciously into God’s presence at death, then we must explain what happens to the wicked, why judgment is still spoken of as future, and how that fits with Scripture’s repeated witness that God has appointed a day of judgment rather than distributing final destinies at the moment of death. When an interpretation creates more contradictions than consolation, it is worth pausing and asking if we have asked the text to carry weight it was never meant to carry.

Another passage sometimes brought forward is Zechariah’s line that God “forms the spirit of man within him.” Yet here again, the text tells us that God is the Maker and Shaper of human inward life—our capacities, our consciousness, our moral nature—but it does not tell us that this “spirit” is an immortal entity living consciously apart from the body. The word “forms” itself suggests shaping and fashioning, like a potter working with clay; it points to God’s craftsmanship, not necessarily to a new, separate substance being created and inserted from outside.

This raises a practical question that presses gently but firmly: if each human spirit is a separately created immortal entity, is God creating these spirits day by day in response to human generation? Scripture’s picture of creation’s completion and the ordinary workings of life makes that conclusion hard to hold without adding many assumptions the Bible does not explicitly supply. It is often safer to say only what we can see: God is the Author of life and mind; He fashions human beings in the womb; our existence is dependent and received; and our future rests in His mercy, not in our self-sustaining nature.

Solomon’s other question—“Who knows the spirit of man… and the spirit of the beast…?”—also deserves a reverent reading. In context, Solomon is pressing the point that, in the realm of mortal life and the experience of death, humans and animals share the same breath and the same return to dust. If he then asks “who knows” whether the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast downward, it reads most naturally as a questioning of confident claims rather than a confident declaration. In other words, he is not building the pagan ladder; he is gently asking for evidence that it stands.

Then there are those poignant prayers at the edge of death: “Into Your hands I commit my spirit.” Jesus speaks the same words on the cross, and Stephen echoes them as he falls asleep. These are holy sentences, and we should not handle them roughly. But notice what they are: acts of trust. They are not anatomy lessons. They do not say, “My conscious self will now live apart from my body.” They say, in effect, “My life is leaving me, and I place it in Your keeping.”

We use similar language even now. We can entrust our “life” to God, ask Him to preserve it, offer it up, lay it down. And no one imagines that the word life in those places refers to a separate immortal person who cannot die. It refers to what is being surrendered, what is being lost, what is beyond our power to hold. That is why the words are so beautiful: at the moment we can no longer keep ourselves, we hand ourselves over to the One who can.

There is also a quiet tenderness in the way the New Testament speaks: our life is “hid with Christ in God,” and it is revealed when Christ appears. That is not the language of a soul that cannot help but remain conscious; it is the language of a life secured by Christ until the day of restoration. It makes hope feel less like speculation and more like safekeeping.

Finally, the phrase “the spirits of just men made perfect” in Hebrews can seem, at first glance, like a photograph of disembodied saints in heaven. Yet the larger movement of the passage is about what believers have “come to” under the gospel—access to God through Christ, the heavenly Jerusalem as our true center of worship, fellowship in one redeemed community, and the sanctifying realities of the new covenant. In that flow, “made perfect” fits naturally with the gospel’s work in living believers, and ultimately with the promised perfection that arrives at glorification, without requiring the idea of conscious spirits floating free between death and resurrection.

In other words, the passage can be read as describing the spiritual communion of God’s people—the reality that in Christ we belong to one assembly, one family, one sanctuary, one Mediator—even when separated by distance, and even when some have fallen asleep. The perfection named is Christ’s work, not death’s work. Death does not sanctify; Christ does.

So if you have leaned on these texts as comfort, you don’t need to feel scolded or shamed. The comfort they offer is real. But it is a different kind of comfort than many assume: not that a deathless part of us simply continues by nature, but that our breath and our life are in God’s hands, and that the God who gives life can guard it, remember it, and restore it at the resurrection. That is a sturdier peace than any theory, because it rests on the trustworthiness of God Himself.
