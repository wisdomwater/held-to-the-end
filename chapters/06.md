# 6. What Is The Purpose Behind Fire And Judgment?

## I. Why Judgment Frightens the Heart

For many, the word *judgment* does not arrive as good news. It arrives with a tightening in the chest, a quiet sense of dread, or a reflexive turning away. Even those who long for justice often find themselves uneasy when judgment is mentioned. Something in us recoils.

This fear is not difficult to understand. Judgment suggests exposure. It implies that what has been hidden will be seen, that what has been avoided will be named, and that what has been carried silently will no longer remain private. For people who have learned to survive by concealment, this can feel threatening rather than hopeful.

Judgment also awakens the fear of abandonment. Many imagine judgment as the moment when God finally withdraws—when patience runs out, mercy gives way to severity, and the soul is left to endure the consequences alone. In this imagination, judgment becomes separation rather than reconciliation, distance rather than nearness.

There is also the fear of pain. Fire, testing, and purification evoke images of suffering without control or relief. For those who have already endured much pain in this life, the thought of more—especially pain imposed by God—can feel unbearable. Judgment is then experienced not as healing, but as harm deferred.

These fears are not abstract. They are shaped by experience. Many have known judgment only as punishment, truth only as accusation, and exposure only as shame. In such a world, it makes sense that judgment would feel like a threat rather than a gift.

Religious language has often reinforced this fear. Judgment has been framed as the suspension of mercy, the moment when love ends and consequences begin. God is imagined as standing apart, weighing failures, and delivering sentences. Under this vision, judgment becomes the place where hope finally collapses.

Yet Scripture itself does not speak of judgment this way. The fear we carry often arises not from the biblical witness, but from a fusion of cultural punishment, moral anxiety, and images of power shaped more by fear than by love. Judgment frightens us because it has been detached from relationship and severed from healing.

Before judgment can be understood rightly, this fear must be acknowledged. Not argued against. Not corrected. Simply named. Fear has its own wisdom. It tells us where trust has been broken and where images of God have become unsafe.

This chapter does not begin by redefining judgment. It begins by listening to the fear it evokes. Only when fear is allowed to speak can truth be received as something other than threat.

Judgment frightens us because we have been taught to expect abandonment, pain without purpose, and exposure without mercy. If judgment is to become good news, these expectations must be gently unlearned—not by force, but by encountering a God whose judgment looks nothing like what we have feared.
