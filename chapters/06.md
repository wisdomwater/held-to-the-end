# 6. What Is The Purpose Behind Fire And Judgment?

## I. Why Judgment Frightens the Heart

For many, the word *judgment* does not arrive as good news. It arrives with a tightening in the chest, a quiet sense of dread, or a reflexive turning away. Even those who long for justice often find themselves uneasy when judgment is mentioned. Something in us recoils.

This fear is not difficult to understand. Judgment suggests exposure. It implies that what has been hidden will be seen, that what has been avoided will be named, and that what has been carried silently will no longer remain private. For people who have learned to survive by concealment, this can feel threatening rather than hopeful.

Judgment also awakens the fear of abandonment. Many imagine judgment as the moment when God finally withdraws—when patience runs out, mercy gives way to severity, and the soul is left to endure the consequences alone. In this imagination, judgment becomes separation rather than reconciliation, distance rather than nearness.

There is also the fear of pain. Fire, testing, and purification evoke images of suffering without control or relief. For those who have already endured much pain in this life, the thought of more—especially pain imposed by God—can feel unbearable. Judgment is then experienced not as healing, but as harm deferred.

These fears are not abstract. They are shaped by experience. Many have known judgment only as punishment, truth only as accusation, and exposure only as shame. In such a world, it makes sense that judgment would feel like a threat rather than a gift.

Religious language has often reinforced this fear. Judgment has been framed as the suspension of mercy, the moment when love ends and consequences begin. God is imagined as standing apart, weighing failures, and delivering sentences. Under this vision, judgment becomes the place where hope finally collapses.

Yet Scripture itself does not speak of judgment this way. The fear we carry often arises not from the biblical witness, but from a fusion of cultural punishment, moral anxiety, and images of power shaped more by fear than by love. Judgment frightens us because it has been detached from relationship and severed from healing.

Before judgment can be understood rightly, this fear must be acknowledged. Not argued against. Not corrected. Simply named. Fear has its own wisdom. It tells us where trust has been broken and where images of God have become unsafe.

This chapter does not begin by redefining judgment. It begins by listening to the fear it evokes. Only when fear is allowed to speak can truth be received as something other than threat.

Judgment frightens us because we have been taught to expect abandonment, pain without purpose, and exposure without mercy. If judgment is to become good news, these expectations must be gently unlearned—not by force, but by encountering a God whose judgment looks nothing like what we have feared.

## II. The Fear of Being Left Alone in the Fire

Beneath every fear associated with judgment lies a deeper one: the fear of being left alone. More than punishment, more than pain, more than exposure, what the heart dreads most is abandonment. The terror is not simply that judgment will hurt, but that it will hurt *without anyone remaining present*.

This fear imagines a moment when God steps back. A moment when patience gives way to distance, when mercy reaches its limit, and when the soul is handed over to suffering as though it were finally unworthy of care. In this imagination, fire becomes the place where relationship ends.

Such fear does not arise from nowhere. Many have learned, through human relationships, that love can be withdrawn when one becomes too much, too broken, or too costly. When care has been conditional in life, it is natural to assume it will be conditional in God.

Religious language has often intensified this fear. Judgment has been described as separation from God rather than encounter with God. Fire has been framed as exile rather than presence. The result is a vision of judgment as a place where God is absent and suffering is endured alone.

This fear also carries a quiet shame. It whispers that there is something about us that makes abandonment reasonable—that if everything were known, God would finally agree that we deserve to be left behind. The fire then becomes proof, not of healing, but of rejection.

At its deepest level, this fear asks a single question: *Will God remain with me when I am fully seen?*

Scripture does not answer this question by denying the seriousness of judgment. It answers it by insisting on the character of God. Again and again, God is revealed not as one who withdraws in the face of brokenness, but as one who draws nearer. The most severe moments in Scripture are often the moments of greatest divine presence, not distance.

This reframes the fear. If God does not abandon, then fire cannot mean exile. If God remains present, then judgment cannot be separation. The terror we associate with fire comes not from Scripture’s vision of God, but from a story in which suffering is endured without companionship.

Naming this fear matters. Until it is acknowledged, reassurance will sound hollow. Promises of mercy will feel conditional. Hope will remain fragile. The heart must first be allowed to say what it is afraid of losing.

The fear of being left alone in the fire is the fear that love has limits. This chapter will move slowly, not to silence that fear, but to meet it—by allowing Scripture to show what kind of God enters the fire and refuses to leave.
